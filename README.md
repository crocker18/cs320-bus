# cs320-bus
Added to GitHub with permission of CS320 instructor, Tyler Caraza-Harter. 

This was the infamous Madison bus project for CS320 Data Programming II at the University of Wisconsin-Madison spring 2020. Most students including myself struggled with this project given it was the first exposure to OOP and BSTs. Course instructor Tyler Caraza-Harter gave the class permission to publish our code for this project since it would be phased out in future semesters.
